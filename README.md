# ðŸ’¯ 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my journey of mastering coding through the **100 Days of Code Challenge**! This challenge is basically to improve my skills, build real-world projects, and develop a consistent coding habit.

## ðŸŒŸ Motivation

The tech world evolves rapidlyâ€”and so should we. This challenge is my way of staying sharp, learning new concepts, improving problem-solving skills, and turning ideas into actual working projects. Whether it's fixing a bug, solving a problem, learning a framework, or building something new, every day is a step forward.
